## Inspiration
One of our team member's family member has Multiple Personality Disorder. Some of the team met him and talked to him about his major pain points. Based on the prompt, we realized that people with MPD are very underrepresented. So, we decided to focus on solving this problem for HackSC.
## What it does
This software allows users to create an identity by entering diary entries and characteristics. Then the user can have a conversation with that identity using a chatbot.
## How we built it
We used next.js for the front end and OpenAI API / Python script for the chatbot. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran out of time, so we were unable to integrate the back end into the front end.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We worked well as a team. Even though we were confused most of the time, we still built software that targeted a problem. 
## What we learned
We learned that Google is our best friend, because many of us are beginner programmers. 
## What's next for ChatSupport
Our team will integrate the front end and back end. Hopefully, we can ship out our software to users to collect user data and iterate.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
